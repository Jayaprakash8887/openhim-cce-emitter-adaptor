# CCE Emitter Adaptor — OpenHIM Channel Setup Guide

Step-by-step guide for the OpenHIM administrator to configure the CCE Emitter Adaptor as a secondary route on the existing eBUZIMA channel.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| OpenHIM Core | v8.4.3+ running and accessible |
| OpenHIM Console | Accessible at `https://<console-host>:9000` |
| Admin credentials | OpenHIM admin account with channel + mediator permissions |
| Emitter Adaptor | Deployed and healthy (`/actuator/health/liveness` returns `UP`) |
| Existing eBUZIMA channel | The channel that routes eBUZIMA EMR traffic to the SHR/other mediators |

## 2. Verify Mediator Registration

The Emitter Adaptor automatically registers with OpenHIM Core on startup. Verify this first.

### Steps

1. Log in to **OpenHIM Console** → navigate to **Mediators** tab
2. Look for **CCE Emitter Adaptor** in the mediator list

### Expected

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | `CCE Emitter Adaptor` |
| URN | `urn:mediator:cce-emitter-adaptor` |
| Version | `1.0.0` |
| Heartbeat | Active (green indicator, updating every ~10 seconds) |

### If mediator is not visible

- Check adaptor logs for registration errors:
  ```bash
  docker logs cce-emitter-adaptor 2>&1 | grep -i "mediator\|registration"
  ```
- Verify `OPENHIM_CORE_HOST`, `OPENHIM_USERNAME`, `OPENHIM_PASSWORD` env vars are correct
- Registration failure is **non-fatal** — the adaptor still functions, but won't appear in OpenHIM Console

## 3. Add Secondary Route to eBUZIMA Channel

The adaptor uses an **empty `defaultChannelConfig`** by design — it does NOT auto-provision a channel. Instead, it is added as a **secondary route** on the existing eBUZIMA channel so that OpenHIM forwards a copy of each request to both the existing primary mediator (e.g., SHR) and the CCE Emitter Adaptor simultaneously.

### Steps

1. Navigate to **Channels** in OpenHIM Console
2. Find and click the **existing eBUZIMA channel** (the one routing eBUZIMA EMR traffic)
3. Go to the **Routes** tab
4. Click **Add Route**
5. Configure the route with the following values:

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Route Name** | `CCE Emitter Adaptor` | Display name in Console |
| **Host** | `<emitter-adaptor-host>` | Docker service name (e.g., `cce-emitter-adaptor`) or IP address |
| **Port** | `8082` | Adaptor HTTP port |
| **Path** | `/inbound` | Adaptor inbound endpoint |
| **Primary** | **No** (unchecked) | **Critical** — must be secondary route |
| **Route Type** | `HTTP` | Plain HTTP (or HTTPS if TLS configured) |
| **Secured** | No | Unless adaptor has TLS configured |

6. Click **Save** on the route
7. Click **Save** on the channel

### Route JSON (equivalent)

If configuring via the OpenHIM Core API directly:

```json
{
  "name": "CCE Emitter Adaptor",
  "host": "cce-emitter-adaptor",
  "port": 8082,
  "path": "/inbound",
  "primary": false,
  "type": "http"
}
```

### Why secondary route?

| Aspect | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **`primary: false`** | The adaptor does NOT return the primary response to the client. The existing primary route (SHR) remains the authoritative responder. |
| **Copy of traffic** | OpenHIM Core sends a copy of each eBUZIMA request to both the primary route and all secondary routes simultaneously. |
| **All HTTP methods forwarded** | Secondary routes receive ALL requests matching the channel URL pattern, regardless of HTTP method. The adaptor gracefully handles non-POST requests (GET, PUT, DELETE, etc.) by returning `200 OK` with a "Non-POST request ignored" message — no 405 errors in the transaction log. |
| **No disruption** | Adding a secondary route does not affect existing routing. If the adaptor is down, the primary route still functions normally. |
| **Transaction log** | OpenHIM records the secondary route response in the transaction log for auditability. |

## 4. Verify the Route

### 4.1 Send a test request through the eBUZIMA channel

```bash
# Send a FHIR Encounter through the eBUZIMA OpenHIM channel
curl -k -X POST https://<openhim-core-host>:5001/ebuzima \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>" \
  -d '{
    "resourceType": "Encounter",
    "id": "channel-test-001",
    "status": "finished",
    "subject": {"reference": "Patient/260225-0002-5501"},
    "period": {"start": "2026-03-09T10:00:00Z"}
  }'
```

> **Note:** Replace the URL path (`/ebuzima`) with the actual eBUZIMA channel URL pattern.

### 4.2 Check OpenHIM Transaction Log

1. Navigate to **Transactions** in OpenHIM Console
2. Find the transaction corresponding to the test request
3. Expand the transaction to see **Routes**
4. Verify:
   - Primary route (SHR) shows its normal response
   - **CCE Emitter Adaptor** secondary route shows `202 Accepted` with `application/json+openhim` response

### 4.3 Check Adaptor Metrics

```bash
curl -s http://<adaptor-host>:8082/actuator/prometheus | grep cce_emitter_events_received
# Expected: cce_emitter_events_received_total{source="ebuzima",path="/inbound"} 1.0
```

## 5. Request Headers Forwarded by OpenHIM

OpenHIM Core automatically sets certain headers when forwarding to routes. The adaptor uses these for source resolution and metadata:

| Header | Set By | Used For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `X-OpenHIM-ClientID` | OpenHIM Core (after client auth) | Primary source resolution — matched against `cce.emitter.sources.<key>.client-id` |
| `X-Source-System` | Source system (optional) | Fallback source resolution |
| `X-Facility-Id` | Source system (optional) | Mapped to CloudEvent `facilityid` extension |
| `X-Source-Event-Id` | Source system (optional) | Mapped to CloudEvent `sourceeventid` extension |
| `X-OpenHIM-TransactionID` | OpenHIM Core (automatic) | **Highest priority** source for CloudEvent `correlationid`. Set automatically by OpenHIM Core on every routed request. |
| `X-Correlation-Id` | Source system or OpenHIM (optional) | Mapped to CloudEvent `correlationid` if `X-OpenHIM-TransactionID` is absent; generated by adaptor if both are absent |
| `Content-Type` | Source system | Expected: `application/json` |

### Client ID Configuration

The `X-OpenHIM-ClientID` value sent by OpenHIM must match the configured client ID:

```yaml
# In the adaptor's application-prod.yml (via EBUZIMA_CLIENT_ID env var)
cce:
  emitter:
    sources:
      ebuzima:
        client-id: ebuzima-emr-client  # Must match OpenHIM client ID
```

To find the eBUZIMA client ID in OpenHIM:
1. Navigate to **Clients** in OpenHIM Console
2. Find the eBUZIMA EMR client
3. Note the **Client ID** value
4. Set `EBUZIMA_CLIENT_ID` env var to this value when deploying the adaptor

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Adaptor not receiving requests | Route not added or channel not saved | Verify route exists on the eBUZIMA channel in OpenHIM Console |
| Non-POST requests showing `200 OK` with "ignored" | Normal behavior — adaptor acknowledges GET/PUT/etc. gracefully | No action needed; only POST requests are processed |
| `200 OK` with no processing | `X-OpenHIM-ClientID` doesn't match configured source | Check `EBUZIMA_CLIENT_ID` matches the OpenHIM client ID |
| Adaptor returns `502` | CCE Collector unreachable or returning 5xx | Check `CCE_COLLECTOR_URL` and Collector health |
| Adaptor returns `500` | Unexpected internal error | Check adaptor logs for stack traces; `INTERNAL_ERROR` code in response |
| Route shows as down in Console | Adaptor container not running or port not accessible | Check `docker ps` and network connectivity on port 8082 |
| Transaction log missing secondary route | Route configured as `primary: true` | Change route to `primary: false` |
| `422 FHIR_MAPPING_ERROR` | Non-FHIR payload sent through the channel | Expected for non-FHIR requests — adaptor rejects gracefully |

## 7. Facility Filter (Phased Rollout)

The facility filter restricts which events are forwarded to the CCE Collector based on facility ID. It is configured entirely via environment variables — no code changes or redeploy needed, only a rolling restart with updated env vars.

### Configuration

| Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `FACILITY_FILTER_IDS` | — | Comma-separated FOSA facility IDs to allow (e.g. `"0030,0042,0099"`). Empty or unset = all events pass. Non-empty = only listed IDs are admitted. Prefixes like `Organization/` are stripped automatically before comparison. |

### Weekly Rollout Workflow (15 → 30 → … → 350 facilities)

1. Engineer raises a PR updating the deployment manifest, adding 15 IDs to `FACILITY_FILTER_IDS`:
   ```yaml
   # Kubernetes Deployment / docker-compose environment
   FACILITY_FILTER_IDS: >-
     0030,0042,0099,0101,0203
   ```
2. PR review — diff is human-readable; add inline comments mapping IDs to facility names.
3. CI applies the manifest (`kubectl apply` / `docker compose up -d`).
4. Rolling restart; readiness probe drains old pods after new pods are ready.
5. Filter is active. Verify in Grafana: new facilities produce 0 denials, previously filtered facilities now producing forwarded events.

### Skip Behaviour

Events that do not pass the filter return `200 OK` with `status: "skipped"` — they are **not** forwarded to the Collector:

```json
{
  "status": "skipped",
  "message": "Event skipped by facility filter: facilityId='9999' source='spice'"
}
```

OpenHIM records this as a **Completed** transaction (not Failed), keeping the transaction log clean. The `cce.emitter.events.filtered.total` Micrometer counter still increments for observability.

### Troubleshooting — Filter

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| All events skipped after setting IDs | `FACILITY_FILTER_IDS` has IDs but none match the incoming requests | Verify the IDs match what source systems send; check adaptor startup log shows correct count |
| Facility ID `0234` rejected despite `0234` in YAML allowlist | YAML coerced unquoted `0234` to integer, stripping the leading zero | Quote all IDs in YAML: `ids: ["0234", "0030"]` — without quotes YAML parses `0234` as `234` |
| Facility `Organization/1302` rejected despite `1302` in list | Source sent FHIR reference prefix — adaptor strips it automatically | Confirm you're on the latest image; verify adaptor startup log shows `Facility filter: active — N facility id(s) configured` |
| Events with no `X-Facility-Id` and no FHIR location rejected | Stale behaviour from an old image | Resources with no resolvable facility ID always pass through; rebuild/redeploy with the latest image |
| Facility filter not active despite `FACILITY_FILTER_IDS` set | Env var not passed to container | Check `docker inspect <container>` → `Env` section |

## 8. Removing the Route

To stop forwarding traffic to the CCE Emitter Adaptor:

1. Navigate to **Channels** → eBUZIMA channel → **Routes**
2. Remove or disable the `CCE Emitter Adaptor` route
3. Save the channel

No cleanup is required on the adaptor side — it is stateless. The Collector handles deduplication, so no data impact from temporarily having the route active then removing it.
